Hashing is a technique used for mapping values to the key, which makes it easy to retrieve values by just entering the key.

Hash function is used to calculate a unique key for each piece of data, which is then used to retrieve the data.

Hash functions are designed to be fast, so that data can be quickly accessed.
They are also designed to be collision resistant, so that two different pieces of data do not have the same key.

Eg. We have an array nums of size 10

    int[] nums = new int[10];    (Suppose this is HashTable)

    We need to store - 23, 44, 51, 71, 86,......

    We use Hash Function to generate key(index) and store value.

    HashFunction in this case would be - f(x) = x mod 10  (as 10 is the size of array nums)

    To store first element 23 - Key(Index) = 23 mod 10  = 3   --> stored at index 3
    To store first element 44 - Key(Index) = 44 mod 10  = 4   --> stored at index 4
    To store first element 51 - Key(Index) = 51 mod 10  = 1   --> stored at index 1
    To store first element 71 - Key(Index) = 71 mod 10  = 1   --> stored at index 1
    To store first element 86 - Key(Index) = 86 mod 10  = 6   --> stored at index 6
    To store first element 26 - Key(Index) = 26 mod 10  = 6   --> stored at index 6


    But 51 and 71 have same key(index). This condition is called 'Hash Collision'.

    Hash Collision can be handled using multiple methods -

    i) Using Open Addressing :-

    In Open Addressing, since 51 has already occupied index 1 so 71 we be stored in next open ie empty index which will be 2 in this case as no
    element has been added to array at index 2 yet.
    Similarly, as 86 is stored at index 6, 26 will be stored at next open index ie 7.

    ii) Using Chaining (uses LinkedList) -

    Since 51 and 71 have same index we point index 2 towards a LinkedList which contains 51 and 71.
    Similarly, 86 and 26 have same index 6 hence index 6 which points towards a LinkedList which contains 86 and 26.

HashSet, HashMap, LinkedHashSet, HashTable are the classes which use Hashing Technique.

When the size of HashTable is not sufficient to store elements, the elements are copied to other larger HashTable and remaining elements are then added.

Load Factor - It is a measure of how full the Hash Table is allowed to be before its capacity can be increased.
