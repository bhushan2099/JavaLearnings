/*
Collections Framework is a framework that provides an architecture to efficiently store and manipulate the data in Java.
E.g. We store integers in an Array but what if you want to - resize the array, insert an element in between,
delete an element from array, etc.

Collection Framework contains Collection Interface, Map Interface and Iterator Interface.(refer diagram)

Java Collections provides Interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and
Classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet)
which help us to write code quickly and efficiently.

Using these classes we can create objects and make use of the data structures.

The java.util package contains all the Classes and Interfaces of the Collections Framework.
